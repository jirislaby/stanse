STANSE Readme
=============

Building
--------

Prerequisities: ant with cpptasks and antlr3 targets
By running
$ ant jar
one gets dist/stanse.jar.

Sometimes ant is unable to find these task definitions even if you put them in
the ant lib location. In that case it usually helps to run ant as follows:
CLASSPATH=tools/ant/antlr3.jar:tools/ant/cpptasks.jar ant jar

Running
-------
Prior to running the appliction, MAKE SURE stcparser-c, stcc and stpreproc from
dist/ directory are in one of paths set in your PATH environment variable. I.e.
all
$ stcparser-c
$ stcc
$ stpreproc
don't complain about command not found, permission denied or any other problem.

For C++ support, you need to download and build the cpp2sir Stanse frontend.
The sources can be found at http://github.org/avakar/cpp2sir. Build them
and place the cpp2sir executable into the dist/bin/ directory.

There are several methods how to invoke Stanse:

1) First of all, one may run stanse by typing
   $ java -jar <path_to_jar>/stanse.jar -gui
   Selecting a file and running tests will result in checker to go through the
   file and report potential errors.

2) Also jobfiles are supported. By putting filenames into a textfile, each on
   its own line and selecting this feature in the gui mentioned in point 1) will
   check all these files.

   -- Advanced use of jobfiles --
   It lays in a following structure (one per line) of jobfiles:
   {filename},{output},{working directory},{compiler flags}
   filename -- a file to check
   output -- a file to output to (.includes and .preproc is appended)
   working directory -- where to run the preprocessor from
   compiler flags -- preprocessor flags (e.g. derived from gcc line)

   Example of checking foo.c with specified flags from /tmp:
   {foo.c},{foo.o},{/tmp},{-I/my_project/include -lm}
   Preprocessor line will look like:
   cd /tmp; cc -E -I/my_project/include -lm -o foo.o.preproc foo.c

3) If your Makefile supports overriding of CC variable (as those generated
   by autoconf/automake do), you can easily obtain a jobfile from point 2)
   by setting CC to stcc. JOB_FILE environment has to be set with a resulting
   jobfile name.

Example of this usage follows:
  $ JOB_FILE=/tmp/my_jobfile make CC=stcc
  After the build finishes in this example, /tmp/my_jobfile contains a list of
  4-tuples which Stanse can understand and use for preprocess as described in 
  the previous point. This generated jobfile is intended to be used in the
  same manner.
